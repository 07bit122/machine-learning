# machine-learning
This is a repo for saving the exercises that I solved as a part of Andrew NG's machine learning coursera course!
I took the course in the summer of 2017. So, the course structure/exercises might change in the future.
> In the spirit of online education, I highly suggest against using this repo for copying the solutions to your exercises.

### Application used
The coursera course suggests using either MatLab / Octave for solving the programming exercises.
I solved the exercises using octave.
```
octave:15> version
ans = 3.8.0
octave:16>
```
